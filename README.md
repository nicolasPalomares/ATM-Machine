# ATM-Machine

This program simulates an Automated Teller Machine (ATM) with functionality for users to perform essential banking operations. Users can choose from options such as "Withdraw," "Deposit," and "Check Balance."

Upon the first run, the program creates a text file to store the balance using a "properties" value. This allows the balance to be saved and accessed in future sessions, ensuring continuity and accurate tracking of transactions.
